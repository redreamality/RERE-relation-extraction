## how to reproduce
The models,ReRe and ReRe_LSTM, in table 3 are provided for reproducing in the dictionary `rere` and `rere_lstm`.
`extraction.py` is the main file.
If you want to train the model, you may use cmd `python extraction.py {data_set_name} train`.
You can also load the model and predict by the cmd `python extraction.py {data_set_name}`,for example `python extraction.py NYT11-HRL`. We can provide the pre-trained model for reproducing exactly the same result as in the paper.

The data set in Figure 3 are provided in `data/FNexp`.The data sets are generated by `data/FN_data_gen.py`.
You can use the cmd`python extraction.py FNexp/{data_set_name}@{radio} train`,for example `python extraction.py FNexp/ske2019@0.1`,to train the corresponding model.

## Notes
The package `bert4keras` that we provided in `./rere/BERT_TF2` can alternatively be installed via `pip install bert4keras`, but we don't guarantee that its latest version works with our code.
If pretrained the models are needed for reproduce, please contact the authors. We are willing to provide them
